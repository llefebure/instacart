# Instacart Market Basket Analysis
This project is my approach to [Instacart's prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis) hosted on Kaggle. The goal is to predict which items will be in a user's next order out of those he or she has ordered in the past. The data for the challenge consists of information on users' past orders and products.
